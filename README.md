# testingSDCtools
This repository is dedicated to the application of the SDC methods implemented in the R-packages included in [SDC-tools](https://github.com/sdcTools) to two types of census data of high resolution: small geospatial areas and grid-cell areas.
A [Working Paper](http://hagstofan.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/2020/e9ea7160-5032-4580-9297-7b3b3cb634da.pdf) has been published based on results for the Icelandic small output areas data.
